            <h2>Here's Why Port Harcourt is The Capital of Bole & Fish</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>As far back as can be remembered, before oil exploration and ‘freedom-fighting’ that is, residents of
                rivers state enjoyed the little pleasures of living ‘freely’ off the land. <br> Plantain grew
                incessantly in the swamps, palm oil, then the main revenue source of the country grew uninhibited, and
                fish…well, it’s called rivers state for a reason.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="logo">

                    Naturally, the people took advantage and the simple yet quintessential combination of roasted
                    plantain and perfectly seasoned mackerel enveloped in a mouthwatering peppery palm oil sauce, also
                    known as bole and fish, was birthed. Bole refers to the roasted plantains and the fish which is
                    usually mackerel is always inexpensive. <br>Today, every street corner from Abuloma to Elekahia
                    boasts colourful umbrellas shielding ankara-clad women engulfed in the pungent,scent of smoked fish
                    and sweet palm oil. The beautiful contrast of white flesh against the blackened mackerel skin, the
                    vibrant red pepper sauce perfectly binds together with just enough heat and spice to make a grown
                    man cry.
                    Within only a few minutes of waiting patiently for ones expectations to be surpassed, the richness
                    and fullness of this very popular road-side meal can be enjoyed, complete with newspaper wrapping
                    and black nylon bag for added safe keeping.

                    Port Harcourt is THE capital of bole and fish. History, culture and numerous satisfied stomachs can
                    testify to this. However, should you still need proof, next time you are in the city, be sure to
                    include a quick stop at D-Line and experience first-handedly, the authentic and flavoursome dish
                    served from the Headquarters of Bole.
