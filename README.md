# 📖 [GLOBAL MUSIC FESTIVAL] <a name="about-project"></a>

**[GLOBAL MUSIC FESTIVAL]** represents a celebration of cultural unity among humanity through the universal language of music. This festival serves as the culminating project of the first module in the Microverse Full-Stack Software Development Curriculum. Utilizing all of the knowledge and skills acquired since the first week of the program, I was able to successfully implement this project.
